A project for **automating the evaluation of job candidate profiles** using Java, Spring Boot, and AI integrations.

## 🗂️ Overview

### 🚀 AI-Powered Candidate Profile Screening & Feedback Tracking

Traditional hiring processes face multiple bottlenecks that reduce efficiency and increase workload for the TA (Talent Acquisition) team:

Profile Screening → Limited resources often lead to ineffective resume screening and repeated evaluation of the same candidate across multiple roles.

Candidate Tracking → Difficulty in maintaining structured feedback across different interview rounds and discussions.

Resource Constraints → Scarcity of TA resources impacts hiring efficiency and turnaround time.

Duplicate Management → High risk of the same candidate being screened multiple times for different positions.

👉 To solve these challenges, this project introduces an AI-driven Recruitment Automation Platform with the following core features:

🤖 AI-powered Resume Screening – Matches resumes against Job Descriptions (JDs), flags duplicates, and provides similarity scoring.

🗂 Centralized Feedback Tracking – Logs, stores, and analyzes structured feedback from different interview rounds.

⚡ Automated Feedback Collection – Uses AI tools to streamline initial screening and capture interviewer evaluations.

📊 Candidate Status & History Database – Maintains candidate lifecycle data to prevent re-screening and ensure consistent tracking.
